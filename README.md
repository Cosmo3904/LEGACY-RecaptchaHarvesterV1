# RecaptchaHarvester

## Written by @Cosm00_

Make sure to setup your hosts file for every site you plan to use this for. Recaptcha must be solved on the domain the sitekey is setup for, so if you solve Adidas sitekey on 127.0.0.1 that will not work. You'll get the invalid domain or whatever error. This script can have the sitekey passed through a command line argument or via input in the script. If you are trying to pass the key via command line use this format: 'python3 main.py SITEKEYHERE'. If not doing that, just follow the input prompts. Hope this is beneficial for you guys. Also thanks peter for the HTML, I stole if from your node harvester whore.
